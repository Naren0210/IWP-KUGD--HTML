                    Since 1998, Krypto University has been preparing students to succeed as skilled engineers, artists,
                    and designers in the growing technology industries.
                <p>An educational pioneer, we were the first college in the world to offer a bachelor’s degree in video
                    game technology and development. Today, we offer a wide range of technology-focused programs, all
                    with an eye toward the career opportunities of tomorrow. Through a combination of academic rigor and
                    interdisciplinary team-based projects, our educational model empowers students to be active
                    learners, bold problem-solvers, and creators.</p>
                <p>Our programs are intentionally designed to reflect the standards and practices of the professional
                    industries: Small teams with different backgrounds and skills collaborate to apply their knowledge,
                    overcome challenges, and build amazing things together. These teams form the core of our tight-knit
                    student and alumni community.</p>
